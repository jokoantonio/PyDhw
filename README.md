# PyDhw
Python code to calculate Degree Heating Weeks (DHW), Monthly Mean Climatology (MM), Maximum Monthly Mean Climatology (MMM), and Hot Spot (HS). In addition, this code also shows a coral bleaching alert graph.
You need a Google Earth engine account to use this code for accessing and extracting the SST dataset in the Google Earth engine (HyCom, NOAA OISST, MODIS-Aqua, NOAA Pathfinder).
There are two files
1. gee_python_dhw_input_point.py : Python script to calculate DHW with point lat lon input and the desired time range (start date and end date).
2. gee_python_dhw_input_poly.py : Python script to calculate DHW with a polygon input and the desired time range (start date and end date).
